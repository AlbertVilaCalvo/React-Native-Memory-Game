## Web version

This app is the React Native version of a game I already created for the Web using only JavaScript - ie with no frameworks like React or Vue. You can [play the Web version online](https://albert-javascript-udacity-memory-game.netlify.app) and also [view it's source code](https://github.com/AlbertVilaCalvo/JavaScript-Udacity-Memory-Game).

```bash
