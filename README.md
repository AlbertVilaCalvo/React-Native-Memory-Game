# React Native Memory Game

A memory game mobile app built with React Native, TypeScript and MobX for state management.

Animations and gestures are implemented with Animated, Reanimated2 and PanResponder.

It's the React Native version of a game I already created for the Web using only JavaScript (ie with no frameworks like React). You can [play the Web version here](https://albert-javascript-udacity-memory-game.netlify.app) and also [check it's source code here](https://github.com/AlbertVilaCalvo/JavaScript-Udacity-Memory-Game).
